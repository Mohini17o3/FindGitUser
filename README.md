## Challenge outline

This challenge involves implementing application using github api. 

The services that you need to use are already implemented - check out ApiService.


__Note__ - This challenge is in angular. We work on angular frameworks & after you join we expect the same from you. Hence it is required to complete this assignement in angular itself.



### Install requirements
* Install angular cli [Ref](https://angular.io/cli)
* `npm install` in this repository 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
